# Vaadin Authentication with Spring Security
---

This is a template under construction for using [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/home) along with [Spring Security](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/).

It is based on [@peholmst](https://github.com/peholmst)'s hybrid security example located [here](https://github.com/peholmst/SpringSecurityDemo/tree/master/hybrid-security)

A blog post detailing his approach can be found [here](https://vaadin.com/blog/-/blogs/a-hybrid-approach-to-spring-security-in-vaadin-applications).

This template builds on top of that by using the more elaborate login screen from the maven archetype `vaadin-archetype-application-example`.

More information about working with this vaadin archetypes can be found [here](https://vaadin.com/maven).

The template currently uses JDBC based authentication and provides a database creation script for a MYSQL database.
